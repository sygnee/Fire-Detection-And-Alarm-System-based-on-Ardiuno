# Fire-Detection-And-Alarm-System-based-on-Ardiuno


Abstract
As per ADSI-2019 report, there were 11037 fire accidents reported across the country in
2019. The number of such reported fire accidents fell by around 18% compared to 2018. India has recorded 1.6 million fire accidents so far involving 27,027 fire accidents deaths. The major accident caused by fire are : building fires, motor vehicle fire defective products, water heater fire, flammable liquids, gas Explosions & smoke.
So, we felt a need to come up with something that is able to prevent such accidents and save
people’s lives and therefore we have created a basic Fire detection and alarm system. Our project is based around the concept of fire detection system. It contains the hardware part of circuit design to rise an alert with the software of programming with a micro- controller i.e. arduino.
A fire defection alarm system has a number of devices working together to detect & worn people through visual & audio appliances when smoke, fire or other emergencies are present. These alarms activate automatically with little to no human intervention required once setup. This project, developed using Arduino & breadboard is based around the concept of fire detection system. It is aimed at detecting fire and then signaling the user through buzzer and LED light. This Fire alarm and detection system focuses on saving people's lives, preventing huge amount of property damage and providing 24-hour protection to it's customers

Introduction
Fire alarm systems provide a means to detect and identify a fire or a potential fire outbreak in a building, warn the occupants of the building about the fire via audible alarm and potentially notify emergency response professionals.
One of the recent fire tragedies that shook India was the Kamala mills fire accident. It was one of the worst fire tragedies of 2017. The accident occurred on 28th December in two rooftop pubs in Mumbai. This accident claimed 14 lives. This cause of fire is claimed to form a hookah. Apart from this, there were a chain of series of fire safety violations in several pubs. These pubs did not have emergency exits nor did they have fire safety equipment in working condition. A fire alarm system warns people when smoke, fire, carbon monoxide or other fire-related emergencies are detected. These alarms may be activated automatically from heat detectors.
Hence, we have created a basic Fire detection and alarm system. Our project is based around the concept of fire detection system. As we see in the above incident we can clearly see and tell that there is lack of fire management system and hence here comes our project into the limelight which is small in size and is also budget friendly. It is compact in size hence it wouldn’t be easily visible to people. Due to which it wouldn’t affect the show of places, buildings & etc.
Our system can be easily accessible to everyone at a low cost and also be available every where so that a person can easily purchase it. Our system can be used in spaces like library, lift’s, houses, offices, factories, public building’s & etc.

Motivation
During the covid days, there was an hospital in my hometown where total 90 patients were in the hospital and 18 more were there in the ICU. Around 3 a.m., fire broke out in the ICU due to short circuit which lead to a massive fire which resulted into the death of all the 18 people in the ICU (14 people and other 4 in serious condition with major injuries). As it was a hospital, there should have been a proper fire alarm system which they claimed of having but it was not functional which means it was of no use.
There were many faults in it like LOOP TROUBLE(A condition which is caused by an interruption of the data communication link (or signaling line circuit) caused by either an "open" circuit, "short" circuit, or device failure), BASE SIGNAL TROUBLE(A fault on a bell or output circuit which displays a variety of specialized messages in addition to the basic trouble message), BATTERY FAULT (Usually indicates a specific problem related to the condition of the stand-by power supply or battery), GROUND FAULT (A condition in which an alarm system references a structure's common ground plane), DATA LOOP TROUBLE , CPU FAULT(Indicates a critical fault has occurred with the common control's main processor) and AC LOSS(Indicates a loss of primary power to the common control which is caused by a tripped main breaker or local power failure). As we all know, most of the times in fire cases, the reasons due to which people die are panic and dangerous gases and smokes. And due to the poor fire system, people in the ICU lost their lives because of not being alerted at the right time which caused delay of them to arrive. Till that time, the fire took a tremendous form which was pretty bad as the fire system lacked in many fire detecting and related responsibilities.
When we heard about this incident, it shook all of us that due to lack of a proper fire alarm and detection system, 18 people had to loose their lives. It motivated us to make a better fire detection system which would help many people from dying and thus saving their lives and so we came up with the idea of creating a basic fire alarm and detection system which will have no faults one fully set-up.

Objective
Fire detection and alarm system has various objectives like in Linear smoke detectors, are ideal for high ceiling areas, and flame detectors, which are specially suited for detection of smokeless liquid and gas fires as well as smoke-forming open fires indoors and outdoors. Alternatively, smoke detectors ensure the detection of smoke- generating flaming and smoldering fires. Alternatively, an aspirating smoke detector continuously draws air samples from the areas requiring protection and evaluates them for the presence of smoke. They ensure reliable fire detection in demanding application areas, where earliest possible fire detection is essential.
Another possibility is the use of our smoke detectors, that are ideal for the early detection of smoke- generating, flaming and smoldering fires. Alternatively, depending on conditions, aspirating smoke detectors or ASA detectors are able to detect even the smallest aerosol concentrations. Depending on the conditions, in addition, flame detectors, are specially suited for environments where deceptive phenomena have to be expected. From a fire safety perspective, the main issues of potential concern are the possible use of combustible insulation, overpressure and unsafe conditions that can result during a fire, including high CO, low O2 and limited time for evacuation. Thus, early and reliable detection is required.
ASA detectors with varying parameter set, depending on the ceiling height, ensure early and reliable detection of all types of fire and a robust response to deceptive phenomena (steam, heat). For higher ceilings we recommend flame detectors which are especially suited for environments where deceptive phenomena have to be expected. Additionally, depending on conditions, we recommend linear smoke detectors which are ideal for high ceiling areas.

Literature Survey
 Table : Literature Survey
• Comprehensive Study on Fire Detection, 2018. Accidents due to undetected fire have caused the great cost to the world. The need for efficient fire detection system is rising. Existing fire, smoke detectors are failing because of the inefficiency of the system. A vision based system with the video surveillance fire detection system is proposed to have high detection rate and low fault alert rate. Real-time fire detection is achieved by analyzing live camera footage. The fire flame features are studied and using edge detection, thresholding methods fire is detected, thus establishing a fire detection model. It uses color, motion, shape, and texture of the fire to detect hazardous fire. Color models like HSV, YCbCr are used in the system for more effective detection. It can be used for both indoor and outdoor scenes.
• Prototype of fire symptom detection system, 2018. One of smart home function is fire alert detection. The symptom detection of fire in the house is important action to prevent the mass fire and save many things. This research applies the new system of fire detection using gas leak concentration to predict the explosion and fire earlier called fire predictor and the fire appearance detector. The fire predictor just show the gas leak concentration and make an alarm rang. The fire detector use fuzzy system to make the fire detector
  
classification. The output simulation system can send the data to MFC, but the MFC reader cannot parse it in real time.
• A system for real-time fire detection,2002. A real-time system for automatic fire detection using color video input is presented. Such a system has significant advantages over traditional ultraviolet and infrared fire detectors. These include improved detection, fewer false alarms, and additional descriptive information about fire location, size, and growth rate. From the physical properties of fire, algorithms are derived for fire detection based on the spectral, spatial, and temporal properties of fire events. These algorithms are integrated into a system that has been tested successfully on a wide range of fire and false alarm stimuli. Experimental results are presented demonstrating system performance on a burning jet fuel fire.
 
Problem Statement –
Problem Specification
No matter how much we take safety measures to prevent fire from happening, a little bit of carelessness or lack of attention by us can seriously damage our properties and can even take our lives. So, keeping this in mind, we have created a mini fire detection and Alarm system which can help organizations and companies to save their buildings and fire from the devastating consequences of fire.
Solution –
We have tried to solve this problem by making a basic system which can detect the fire by signaling to the user through a buzzer. It consists of an Arduino board, a flame sensor, an LED light and a buzzer.

Proposed System
Firstly, we need to connect one line of the breadboard to the ground and the other to the power supply. This is done by connecting the 5V pin of the Arduino Board to one line of connection pins on the breadboard. The other line of the breadboard is connected to the ground terminal of the Arduino Board. These lines will be connected to other devices.
The Temperature sensor has three pins. Ground, Vout, and Vs (Supply). The Vs pin that has a range of 4 -20V is connected to the power supply line of the breadboard. The Ground terminal of the sensor is connected to the ground line of the breadboard. The Vout terminal of the temperature sensor is connected to one of the Analog pins of the Arduino Board, A1. We have to learn how the connections are done with the Gas sensor. This sensor has 6 pins. 3 pins of the gas sensor are directly connected to the power supply line of the breadboard. Amongst the other 3 pins of the sensor, one pin is connected to one of the Analog pins of the Arduino Board, A0. The pin in the middle is connected to the ground line of the breadboard.
The third pin of the sensor is connected to a resistor and then connected to the ground line. The Temperature sensor has three pins. Ground, Vout, and Vs (Supply). The Vs pin that has a range of 4 -20V is Proposed System connected to the power supply line of the breadboard. The Ground terminal of the sensor is connected to the ground line of the breadboard. The Vout terminal of the temperature sensor is connected to one of the Analog pins of the Arduino Board, A1.

const int flamepin=A2;
const int buzpin=11;
const int threshold=200;// sets threshold value for flame sensor

flamesensvalue=analogRead(flamepin); // reads analog data from flame sensor
if (flamesensvalue>=threshold) { // compares reading from flame sensor with the threshold value
digitalWrite(ledpin,HIGH); //turns on led and buzzer
tone(buzpin,100);
delay(1000); //stops program for 1 second
}
else{
digitalWrite(ledpin,LOW); //turns led off led and buzzer
noTone(buzpin);
}
} 
 
Implementation/Execution
First, D0 pin of the flame sensor is connected to A2 pin of Arduino board. Then the ground pin of the sensor is connected to the ground pin of board. Vcc pin of the sensor is connected to the 5V pin of the board. Then we connect the buzzer to the breadboard in column ‘e’ and row 1(positive) and 4(negative).Then we connect the breadboard with Arduino with 2 cables where, the positive terminal is connected in column ‘b’ row 1 to 11th Digital pin of board. And the negative terminal of breadboard column ‘b’ row 4 is connected to the ground pin of the board. We connect the LED in which the positive terminal is connected to the 13th pin of the board and negative terminal is connected to the ground pin of the board. Finally we connect the Arduino to the system and upload the code. And then whenever flame comes near to the flame sensor, the LED will light up and the buzzer will start beeping & alert the user.
Temperature sensor and its output. The Temperature sensor takes in input and when the temperature increases, the voltage increases, and hence the output initiates the functioning of the Buzzer. For every one degree increase in temperature, there is a 10mV increase in the voltage. Gas sensor and its output. A gas sensor is also used to detect smoke along with the concentration of gases. Based on the type of gas present in the atmosphere, a potential difference is developed by changing the Resistance of the material present inside the sensor and the same is measured as output. The Concentration of the gas is measured in ppm and the output analog value is needed to be converted into digital which is done by the #ADC (Analog to Digital Converter) present in the sensor itself. Based on the condition given in the code, the LED glows or remains OFF.

Applications
1) Generator buildings - In complex environments like generator buildings, the ASA detectors are able to detect even the smallest aerosol concentrations and offer the ideal solution for generator buildings. Linear smoke detectors, are ideal for high ceiling areas, and flame detectors, which are specially suited for detection of smokeless liquid and gas fires as well as smoke-forming open fires indoors and outdoors.
2) Hospital rooms - The ASA detectors with super sensitive parameter set are ideal for hospital rooms as they reliably distinguish between a real fire and deceptive phenomena like dust, steam or gas.
3) Operating rooms – In operating rooms, flammable prepping material, alcohol-based liquids, electrical malfunction and an additional oxygen supply are some of the tipical hazards. Early and reliable detection is required. So, the ASA detectors with super sensitive parameter set offer early and reliable detection.
4) Plant rooms - An overload or short circuit of an electrical component and failure of the cooling system leading to excessive overheating of electronic components (e.g. microcontroller) are typical hazards. So, aspirating smoke detectors can detect minimal smoke concentrations which may be caused by the malfunction of an individual electrical device or electronic component.
5) Elevators - Human behavioral actions, as well as the electrical and mechanical aspects can be presented as fire hazards. Earliest possible detection is required. So ,the Smoke detectors ensure an early detection of smoke-generating flaming and smoldering fires with minimal deceptive phenomena.
6) Carpenter workshops - Woodworking is an activity with a high fire risk due to the high fire load of wood and dust presence, as well as the existence of volatile organic compounds present in varnishing, painting or lacquering operations. So, the ASA detectors and/or aspirating smoke detectors ensure early and reliable detection of all fire types and robust response to deceptive phenomena.
